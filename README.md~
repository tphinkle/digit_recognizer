##digit recognizer

My attempt at a digit recognizer for a www.kaggle.com competition.

First solution:

Create path around character and create two 'time-series' of x- and y-positions for each step.
Compare the time series of each test digit with the time series of the training digits via dynamic time warping (DTW) methods.

~30% and very slow

Second solution:

Simple logistic regression approach based on identifying digit features.
